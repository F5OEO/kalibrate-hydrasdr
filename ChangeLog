# Changelog

## v0.4.3 – New HydraSDR Features

### Added

* **Hardware-Specific DSP**
  * Introduced a *Polyphase Rational Resampler* to convert the HydraSDR native sampling rate (2.5 MSPS) to the GSM symbol rate (270.833 kSPS).
  * Achieves **>60 dB aliasing rejection** for high-quality decimation and timing accuracy.

* **Direct Flash Calibration**
  * Added support to **read** and **write** frequency correction values to the device’s SPI Flash.
  * Device now **auto-resets** after calibration writes, ensuring changes are applied immediately.

* **Visualization & Diagnostics Tools**
  * New **ASCII Art FFT** mode (`-A`) for in-console spectrum visualization.
  * Added **DSP Benchmark** mode (`-k`) to test local CPU processing performance.

* **Optimized Scanning**
  * Implemented a fast *Power Scan* stage to pre-filter candidate frequencies.
  * Provides up to **10× faster** band scanning compared to older versions.

* **Multi-Platform Build System**
  * Migrated build to **CMake**, enabling seamless compilation on Windows, Linux, and macOS.
